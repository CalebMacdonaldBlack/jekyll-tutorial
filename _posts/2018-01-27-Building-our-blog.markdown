In this step we're going to create a blog post. This process is very similar to creating a page, but posts have a different filename format and different frontmatter.

## Creating a file for our post

We mentioned earlier that posts are added to the `_posts` directory of our Jekyll site. But they also have to be created with a specific filename format to help Jekyll understand how to order them.

The blog post filename format includes a date at the start of the filename formatted as follows:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-<blog-post-filename>.md
```

This date is generally used to denote the publish date of an article or blog post, allowing you to create files for blog posts at any time but allowing them to always be ordered correctly for Jekyll. For example we may publish a blog post on November 22nd 2018 about Monty Python. We would name that file `2018-11-22-monty-python.md`.

**Create a file with November 14th 2018's date called 'Yet Another Post'.** This file should be named `2018-11-14-yet-another-post.md`.

## Adding frontmatter

If we have a look at the frontmatter of the default post `2018-11-22-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` we'll find the following frontmatter:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2018-11-17 21:48:29 +1000
categories: jekyll update
---
```

### Post Frontmatter Properties

We're going to use this as a basis for our own frontmatter. We're already familiar with the `layout` and `title` properties in frontmatter, but lets have a look at the `date` and `categories` fields. We'll also have a look a frontmatter field we haven't seen before `published`.

#### Date

The date field allows you to set a high-precision time and date for the time which will be shown on the posts when they are displayed on the website.

The date field takes the form of a time and date in the [YAML datetime format](http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html):
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TZ
```

If a timezone is not specified the time is assumed to be in UTC.

#### Categories

Categories help configure the URL scheme of a post and can help you categorise your posts, or even run multiple blogs on a single Jekyll site. The category property is simply a space seperated list of strings which will be added as a path in the post URL.

For example the default post above, with the categories 'jekyll' and 'update' has the following URL generated by Jekyll:

```
http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2018/11/22/welcome-to-jekyll.html
```

#### Published

Published is a simple boolean flag that determines if a post is published to the website. By setting this to `false` you can publish draft posts which can't be viewed to by users.

### Setting our frontmatter

Now that we understand a bit more about our posts frontmatter we're going to setup some frontmatter for our first new blog post.

**Setup a post called 'Yet another blog post', published November 14th 2018 at 11pm UTC, with the category 'test'.** This is what your frontmatter should look like:

```
---
layout: post
title:  Yet another blog post
date:   2018-11-14 23:00:00
categories: test
---
```

If we head to the [home page](http://localhost:4000) of our blog we should now see our new post listed below the 'Welcome to Jekyll!' post which was published today. By default this list shows all categories, but you can customise to show only one, or only a few categories.

If you click the post you'll see our new blank post with the `test` category in the URL.

## Adding our content

We're going to get a little more creative with our content now.

**Write a brief paragraph or page in markdown underneath your frontmatter on this post.** Try to use a variety of different markdown formatting tags to get used to them. If you skipped the tutorial earlier either jump into [markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) or use the paragraph below as inspiration for your own.

```
# Markdown Features
## Text Features
Markdown allows you to *emphasize*, **embolden**, or _underline_ text. You can even **combine these _together_**. Markdown also includes other crucial features like:

- Lists
  1. Ordered Lists
  2. Unorderded Lists
- [Links](http://google.com)
- Inline `code`

## Block features

In addition to the text features there are a number of block features which create larger formatted objects.



\```
Code Block
\```

***

Horizontal Rules

***

To seperate sections

***


| Tables | with | headings |
|--------|------|----------|
| and    | cell | content  |
| even | if | its out of line |

> Block quotes
> even if they run over multiple lines
>
> Or have multiple paragraphs

```

**Save your completed content into your post and open up your post.** This is how ours looks with the content we've provided.

## Un-publishing our blog post

As we mentioned earlier, there are times when you're preparing a blog post and may want your draft to remain unpublished. **Change your frontmatter to unpublish this post:**

```
---
layout: post
title:  Yet another blog post
date:   2018-11-14 23:00:00
categories: test
published: false
---
```

If you now refresh your page displaying the post it should provide you with only a `404 Not Found` page, indicating that the post is no longer published to the website.

**Set published to `true` now to republish your post**
